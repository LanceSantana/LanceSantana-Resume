        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre - Business ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">An individual with high energy and a charismatic personality, currently attending UC Riverside for Pre-Business; to eventually obtain a master's in Business Administration. Offering strong leadership skills, exceptional communication skills, high attention to detail, and a strong ambition to improve the community at UC Riverside.
                            I have refined general skills such as teamwork, leadership, professionalism, and communication through my past volunteer and work experience. I have been a patrol leader in boy scouts leading eight to twelve scouts, which has helped me work with planning, leadership, and problem-solving skills. In a more professional setting, I have worked as a Business Development Associate at an insurance agency, assisting in advertisement, customer service, and employee training in a professional setting. Other volunteer work includes Reading Partners as a reading tutor and Marengo Elementary as a Teacher Assistant, has helped me further my interpersonal skills while working with children. Outside of volunteer work as an individual, I have competed in robotics competitions with STEM classes such as graphic design, web design, and computer science, providing notable experience working with technology and design. Giving back to a community that supports me and seeing the change that results because of it makes me feel a sense of pride, accomplishment, and appreciation. 
        <br><br>

        During my college career, I have joined several organizations to help bring change to campus and to be involved in my community. PBL Future Business Leaders of America is one organization on campus that I have participated in since the start of my time at UCR. PBL has helped me obtain my Career Success certificate and further develop soft skills in a professional setting. Other organizations, such as Râ€™Shorts, have given me the opportunity to gain experience in the film industry connecting me with positions in the school play and a short film. Experience in smaller local productions is helping me learn more about the industry while I do contract work as a grip in Los Angeles. Some projects I have worked on include; several commercials for Lagavulin Whiskey and the TV show surfside girls. This being my first year as a college student, I decided to join several organizations to help me diversify my portfolio. Over the next three years on campus, I plan to deepen my relationship with these organizations and take on new volunteer opportunities as they come over the year.<br><br>

        As a student progressing in my college career, I am looking forward to any new opportunities that will develop my professional process while further developing my community. Throughout the rest of my time as a college student, I plan on continuing my education into graduate school for a master's in Business Administration. With an MBA and minors in computer science, I plan on pursuing a career working as a project manager at a technology company. Hopefully, with future internships, I will be able to pursue my education while developing myself professionally in this field.
